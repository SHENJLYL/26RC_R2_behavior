# RC R2 Behavior Tree Current Progress

Date: 2026-07-05

## Goal

Create the ROBOCON 2026 R2 behavior tree content in `26RC_R2_behavior`, including the ROS 2 / BehaviorTree.CPP runner, XML task flow, launch files, params, plugin nodes, and integration records.

The package is intentionally structured after PB2025's behavior package pattern: server/client executables, launch files, params, XML behavior trees, and small plugin nodes.

## PB2025 Structure Followed

PB2025 files and patterns followed while writing this R2 behavior tree:

- Package metadata and build layout: `package.xml`, `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Runner shape: behavior server, behavior client, launch, params.
- Plugin shape: small BehaviorTree.CPP action/condition nodes.
- XML organization: main tree plus reusable subtrees.
- General node style: `IsManualStart`, `PubNav2Goal`, `PublishTwist` style wrappers.

## Competition Terminology

Terminology follows the rule PDF:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `武馆(MC)` | Zone 1; start, retry, and weapon assembly area |
| `梅林(MF)` | Zone 2; includes the forest, R1 passage, R2 entrance, and R2 exit |
| `树林` | The 12 numbered blocks inside MF; R2 operates here |
| `对抗区` | Zone 3; includes ramp, nine-grid rack, and retry zone |
| `端头` | Official V6 term for the weapon tip part |
| `端头架(SHR)` | Rack in MC that holds the end pieces |
| `兵器` | Assembled weapon consisting of long pole, end piece, and quick connector |
| `KFS` | Kung Fu Scroll; includes R1 KFS, R2 KFS, and fake KFS |
| `九宫格` | 3x3 rack in the battlefield area, with bottom/middle/top layers |

Legacy code identifiers such as `spearhead_rack_standoff` are kept as interface names for now; human-facing descriptions use `端头` and `端头架`.

## Current Scope

Package name: `r2_behavior`

Current behavior tree content contains:

- `r2_behavior_server`
- `r2_behavior_client`
- `IsManualStart`
- `NavigateToNamedPose`
- `PubNav2Goal`
- `PublishTwist`
- R2 XML behavior trees
- launch, params, tests, and documentation

## Behavior Trees

### `R2_Competition_Main`

```text
PreMatchAndStart
-> MC_AssembleWeapon
-> WaitForR1BeforeR2LeavesMC
-> MF_CollectSingleR2KFS
-> MF_ExitForest
-> Battlefield_PlaceMiddleLayer
-> StopAllMotion
```

Emergency stop and retry branches are present but still use placeholders until the real wired/safety/retry interfaces are defined.

### `R2_DryRun_WithMocks`

Smoke-test tree that exercises:

- `PubNav2Goal` on `goal_pose`
- `PublishTwist` on `cmd_vel`

Use this to test tree loading and topic publishing without claiming the full robot task is connected.

### `R2_Full_Flow_Verification`

Full process verification tree that replaces unavailable navigation/manipulation/perception capabilities with `AlwaysSuccess` mocks. It is used to verify that the competition flow can proceed in order without depending on Gazebo, Nav2, vision, or manipulation.

## Current Nodes

| Node | Implemented in | Interface |
|---|---|---|
| `IsManualStart` | `plugins/condition/is_manual_start.cpp` | subscribes `manual_start` `std_msgs/msg/Int32` through `r2_behavior_server` |
| `NavigateToNamedPose` | `plugins/action/navigate_to_named_pose.cpp` | calls `/r2/navigation/navigate_to_named_pose` action |
| `PubNav2Goal` | `plugins/action/pub_nav2_goal.cpp` | publishes `geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped`, default topic `goal_pose`, fixed frame `map` |
| `PublishTwist` | `plugins/action/pub_twist.cpp` | publishes `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`, default topic `cmd_vel` |

BehaviorTree.CPP built-ins still used:

- `AlwaysSuccess`
- `AlwaysFailure`
- `Sequence`
- `ReactiveFallback`
- `SubTree`

## Real Interfaces Connected Now

| Capability | Interface | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Manual start | `manual_start` `std_msgs/msg/Int32` | Connected |
| Named-pose navigation | `/r2/navigation/navigate_to_named_pose` | Connected at BT action-client level; navigation server and waypoint quality must still be validated separately |
| Outside navigation goal topic | `goal_pose` `geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped` | Connected with placeholder coordinates |
| Stop chassis | `cmd_vel` `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` | Connected for zero-speed publish |

## Not Connected / Unknown Nodes Waiting For Integration

| Capability | Placeholder node/interface |
|---|---|
| Health monitor | `/r2/health/status` |
| Emergency stop input | `/r2/emergency_stop` |
| Retry handling | `/r2/retry/request`, `/r2/retry/execute` |
| Spearhead detection/pick | `/r2/manipulation/pick_tip` |
| R1 assembly readiness | `/r2/perception/r1_assembly_ready` |
| R1 entered MF | `/r2/perception/r1_entered_mf` |
| Forest entry/exit primitives | `/r2/forest/enter`, `/r2/forest/exit` |
| KFS block map | `/kfs_tracker/detection -> /r2/perception/kfs_map` |
| Forest graph planner | `/r2/forest/planner` |
| Woods graph navigation | `/r2/nav/go_to_woods_block`, `/r2/nav/follow_woods_graph_path` |
| Adjacent KFS pick | `/r2/manipulation/pick_adjacent_kfs` |
| Suction command and payload state | `/cmd_suction_suck`, `/r2/perception/payload_state` |
| Grid state and target cell | `/r2/perception/grid_state`, `/r2/strategy/select_grid_cell` |
| Middle-layer place | `/r2/manipulation/place_kfs_middle` |

Unknown nodes are intentionally kept outside the BT package until their ROS interfaces are confirmed. Candidate examples include KFS map conversion, forest graph planner, rule guard, suction feedback, grid-state perception, target-cell strategy, and manipulation task servers.

## Action Preparation Archive

`action preparation/` has been added as the interface-preparation archive for future R2 task integration.

It records:

- Task-level action/service/topic candidates.
- Required sensor observations and state topics.
- Mapping from current behavior-tree placeholders to future real interfaces.
- Rule-derived constraints for payload, KFS handling, forest traversal, R1 QR state, and middle-layer placement.

These documents are preparation records only; they do not mean the listed actions have already been implemented.

## Known Gaps

- Waypoints are still `0.0;0.0;0.0`.
- `PubNav2Goal` currently uses `frame_id="map"`; verify against real navigation.
- `NavigateToNamedPose` can call the action, but actual navigation success depends on the external `r2nav` server, calibrated waypoints, localization, and chassis behavior.
- Suction has command topic but no feedback loop.
- KFS tracker output is not yet converted into a block-indexed map.
- MoveIt2 task-level actions are not wrapped yet.
- Forest graph traversal and rule guard are not implemented.
- Rule PDFs need a later audit before real competition use.

## Verified

- Runtime layout test passes: `python test/test_independent_runtime_layout.py`.
- XML parse checks pass for current behavior trees.
- `colcon build` passes with build/install/log kept under `26RC_R2_behavior`.
- Dry-run server loads `R2_DryRun_WithMocks`; the test run was stopped by `timeout` after confirming the tree loaded and ticked.
- `R2_Full_Flow_Verification` was launched and returned BT `SUCCESS`; rosbag captured `/manual_start` and `/cmd_vel`, confirming the flow-verification tree can proceed through the mocked process.

## Minimal Next Debug Steps

1. Source ROS and build this package.
2. Launch `r2_behavior` with `r2_behavior_dry_run.yaml`.
3. Confirm `goal_pose` and `cmd_vel` with `ros2 topic echo`.
4. Replace waypoint placeholders with calibrated poses.
5. Implement one real interface at a time, starting with health check, payload feedback, KFS map, and forest rule guard.
